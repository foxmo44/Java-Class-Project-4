# Java-Class-Project-4
A java project to demonstrate interfacing to a database and using streams and lambda functions

The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic database interaction using Java. The program
needs to read data from the provided file (it is the same data you used for project 03):
"Project04Data.csv" and insert the data into a database. Then the program needs to create a
report from the database sorted by price descending.
